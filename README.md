## General Information
- Motivation: Interested in learning more about nightly price influences and trends in Boston Airbnb market
- Project seeks to answer questions:
- What percentage of hosts are superhosts?
- How does the average nightly price vary by the number of bedrooms?
- How does the average nightly price vary by neighborhood?
- Can the average nightly price be predicted based on certain variables?
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
